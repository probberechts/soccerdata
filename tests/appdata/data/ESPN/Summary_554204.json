final match of his second stint at the club, took his tally to 10 league goals since returning in January and became the oldest player to score 10 or more goals in a Serie A season.</p>\n<p>The

Rafael Leao hit the post from a narrow angle but the ball bounced off the Estonian defender and into the net.</p>\n<p>Leao also rattled the crossbar before Milan were awarded a penalty for handball by <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/288483/Sebastian-Walukiewicz\">Sebastian Walukiewicz</a> one minute before halftime. However, Ibrahimovic's spot kick was saved by <a href=\"/soccer/player/_/id/165768/Alessio-Cragno\">Alessio Cragno</a>.</p>\n<p>Ibrahimovic made amends when he scored with an emphatic finish from <a
